# BSit - Assignment, Backend NodeJS

Hello BSit team!
Hope you're ready for the review! Here you can find the backend for the assignment.

## Instructions
Based on [this](https://github.com/ngryman/lol-champions/blob/master/champions.json) dataset, develop a web application served by a REST API. The application should display a list of the champions with a `load more` functionality and a detailed view by champion. The informations to display on the list and on the detailed view are up to you.

The code should be written in JavaScript, any library or framework can be used. The application can either be desktop, mobile, or both. You can send your code anytime you want, there's no dead line

## Dtails

I chose to build a REST API using NodeJS, and for the frontend, you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/KevinTss/bsit--assignment-frontend-vuejs).

### Quick start

#### Prerequisite

You need Node installed on you machine

#### Command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KevinTss/bsit--assignment-backend-nodejs.git
cd bsit--assignment-backend-nodejs && npm install && npm run start:local
```

> In that use case, I have pushed the env folder because there are not real reasons to use it. The purpose is just to show how I work with environnement variables.
